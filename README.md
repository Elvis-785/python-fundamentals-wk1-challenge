# Phase 3 Code Challenge: Python Fundamentals - Compulsory

## Python Coding Assessment

### Topics :
- Basic data structures
- Functions
- Decorators
- Sequences
- Sets, Dictionaries
- Object-Oriented Programming


# Add Numbers Function

## Description
the add_number.py script defines a function named `add_numbers` that takes two parameters `num1` and `num2`, and returns their sum. It provides a simple way to perform addition of two numbers.

# Is Even Function

## Description
This Python script defines a function named `is_even` that takes a single parameter `num` and returns `True` if the number is even, and `False` otherwise. I used the control flow `if` `else` statements.

# Count Vowels Function

## Description
This Python script defines a function named `count_vowel` that takes a string `text` as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. The function ignores case sensitivity and provides a simple way to count the number of vowels in any given text.

# Calculate Factorial Function

## Description
This Python script defines a function named `calculate_factorial` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the factorial of that number. The function includes input validation to ensure the input is a non-negative integer.

# Python Coding Challenges

## Description
This repository contains solutions to a series of Python coding challenges. Each challenge is designed to test your understanding of fundamental Python concepts, including decorators, sorting sequences, working with dictionaries, and object-oriented programming.

### 1. Function: apply_decorator 
Write a Python function named `apply_decorator` that takes a function `func` as input and applies a decorator named `decorator_func`. The decorator should simply print "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.


# Sort By Age

The sequence.py scripts sorts a list of people by their age. The script defines a function `sort_by_age` that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and an age, and returns the list sorted by age.


# Merge Dictionaries

This Python script defines a function `merge_dicts` that merges two dictionaries by adding the values of any keys that are present in both dictionaries.

# Car Class

This Python script defines a `Car` class that models a car with attributes such as make, model, and year. It also includes a method to display car information.
